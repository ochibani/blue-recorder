A simple desktop recorder built using GTK4 and FFmpeg. 

- It supports recording audio and video on Windows and almost all Linux and FreeBSD interfaces with support for Wayland display server on GNOME and KDE sessions.
- The following formats are currently supported: avi, gif, mkv, mp4, nut, webm and wmv.
- You can choose the audio input source you want from the list.
- You can also set the default values you want by simply changing them in the interface, and the program will save them for you for the next time you open it. 

This project is based on [Green Recorder](https://github.com/mhsabbagh/green-recorder) and is rewritten in Rust with improvements.
